title: The Development of This Blog
---

This is the first time that I tried to write a personal tech blog and the first time that I tried to build a blog from scratch. So I was thinking to write a post as a record of how I did it. Even though there are lots of website templates out there for people to choose and you can probably use one of those that people share on their GitHub for free, I feel more satisfied by building the blog on my own. Plus, it is a great opportunity for me to learn about web development.

Before actually buidling the blog, I need to consider what type of web pages I would like to build. Generally, there are two - static and dynamic. Static web pages deliver to the user with the same prebuilt content each time the page is loaded. They have the same structure and content unless the web developer updates and publishes new changes. In contrast, dynamic web pages are generated by a web-application. These pages have server-side scripts which are processed by the application server to generate unique conten every time the page is loaded. As for a personal blog, its implementation is on a small scale without many pages required, it doesn't need to be generated on-the-fly and I will be the only one who manages and updates the website; therefore, a static web page is more suitable for my need.

The other thing that I would like for my blog is a custom URL. I got my domain name free through attending a start-up weekend, so I will skip the detail of this step. But it wouldn't be hard to get a custom domain name from many domain name registrars in the market.

Once I've decided what type of website I would like to develop and got my custom domain name, I can now actually start building my blog. Here are the components of this blog:

####Blog Hosting - GitHub Pages

**Generate a Site**

First of all, the blog needs to be hosted through a web hosting service, so that the webiste is accessible via the Internet. I use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), because it's free and I was going to commit the files for this blog to [my GitHub](https://github.com/francesliang/francesliang.github.io) anyway. If you are not familiar with GitHub then [here](https://github.com/) is their website. 

As the [instructions](https://pages.github.com/) mentioned on GitHub Pages, the followings are the steps to create a site:  

1. Create a new repository named "*username*.github.io" on your GitHub, where *username* is your username on GitHub.

2. Clone the repository to the folder where you want to store your project locally on your computer:

	```
	~$ git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
	```
	
3. Create an index.html and add other files related to your project in the project folder.

4. Add, commit, and push your changes in the project folder to GitHub using the following commands:

	~$ git add --all  
		
	~$ git commit -m "Initial commit"  

	~$ git push -u origin master  

5. Now you have generated your webiste: "*http://username.github.io*".

**Customise URLs**

You may notice that the URL of the website you just created is "*http://username.github.io*". In order to use a custom URL, we need to [set up the custom domain with GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/):  

1. Create a CNAME file that contains the custom domain (the content of the file is: "*yourdomain.com*") to your repository's root directory (in your repository's Pages branch). Then commit and push the file. This is to redirect your GitHub Pages site using your custom domain.  

2. Configure a custom apex domain (e.g. *yourdomain.com*) -  for the root apex (@) to point to *username.github.io*

	+ With your DNS provider, create A records (in the DNS manager) that point to the following IP address:

		- 192.30.252.153

		- 192.30.252.154

			![A record]()

	+ If your DNS provider supports ALIAS records or ANAME records, then you may choose to create an ALIAS or ANAME record and point it to *username.github.io* instead.  

3. Configure a custom subdomain (e.g. *www.yourdomain.com*) - for www. to point to *username.github.io*

	+ In your DNS manager, create a CNAME record and point it to *username.github.io*. See the following as an example:

		![CNAME record]()

4. Check if your name server has been updated using the *dig* command:

	~$ dig *yourdomain.com* +nostats +nocomments +nocmd

If the congifuration is successful, you should be able to access to your webiste through both *yourdomain.com* and *www.yourdomian.com*.
