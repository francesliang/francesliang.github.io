title: The Development of This Blog
---

This is the first time that I tried to write a blog and the first time that I tried to build a blog from scratch. So I was thinking to write a post as a record of how I accomplished this task. Since I'm a total beginner, there might be some shallow understandings and explanations, please point out if so.

To have a personal blog, first of all, you will need a domain name. I got mine free through attending a start-up weekend, so I will skip the detail of this step.

The next thing is to host the blog.
